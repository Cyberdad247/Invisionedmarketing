# Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! To ensure a smooth workflow and maintain code quality, please follow these guidelines:

## Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new features: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Use bugfix branches for fixes: `bugfix/your-bug-description`
- Use `main` for production-ready code
- Always branch from the latest `main`

## Pull Requests
- Create pull requests (PRs) for all changes
- Provide a clear title and description
- Reference related issues or tasks
- Request reviews from relevant team members
- Ensure all checks pass before merging

## Code Style
- Follow the project's established code style (see `.editorconfig`, `eslint`, `black`, etc.)
- Use the `# Reason:` comment practice to explain non-obvious code
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code

## Testing
- Add or update tests for your changes
- Run all tests locally before submitting a PR
- For frontend: use Jest/RTL for unit tests, Cypress/Playwright for E2E
- For backend: focus on critical business logic and API endpoints

## Accessibility & Usability
- Consider accessibility in all UI changes
- Follow best practices for usability

## Getting Help
