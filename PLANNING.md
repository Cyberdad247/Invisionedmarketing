# PLANNING.md 
 
 ## Project Overview 
 
 **Project Name:** IDE Agent 
 
 **Description:** An intelligent agent to assist developers within the IDE, automating tasks and improving code quality. 
 
 ## Goals 
 
 *   Improve developer productivity and efficiency. 
 *   Automate routine coding tasks. 
 *   Enhance code quality and maintainability. 
 *   Provide real-time feedback and suggestions. 
 
 ## Architecture 
 
 *   **Frontend:** IDE Extension (VS Code, IntelliJ, etc.) using TypeScript/JavaScript 
 *   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) with a microservices architecture for specialized tasks. 
 *   **Communication:** RESTful APIs and potentially WebSockets for real-time updates. 
 
 ## Tech Stack 
 
 *   **Frontend:** 
     *   TypeScript/JavaScript 
     *   React/Vue.js (depending on the IDE framework) 
     *   Radix UI for component library 
     *   Tailwind CSS for styling 
     *   next-themes for theming 
     *   Storybook for component documentation 
 *   **Backend:** 
     *   Python 3.10+ 
     *   FastAPI for API framework 
     *   SQLAlchemy/SQLModel for ORM (if applicable) 
     *   PostgreSQL for database 
     *   PNPM for package management 
 *   **Tools:** 
     *   Docker for containerization 
     *   PNPM for package management 
     *   ESLint, Prettier, Black for linting and formatting 
     *   Pytest for testing 
     *   Swagger UI/OpenAPI for API documentation 
     *   Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring 
     *   Vercel Analytics for frontend performance 
     *   HashiCorp Vault or similar for secrets management 
 
 ## Constraints 
 
 *   **Performance:** The agent should not significantly impact IDE performance. 
 *   **Security:** Ensure the agent does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. 
 *   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured and easy to maintain. 
 *   **Scalability:** The architecture should support future expansion and new features. 
 
 ## Development Workflow 
 
 1.  **Branching:** Use feature branches for all new development. 
 2.  **Pull Requests:** All changes must be submitted via pull requests. 
 3.  **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for all pull requests. 
 4.  **Testing:** Unit tests must be written for all new features and bug fixes. 
 5.  **Linting & Formatting:** Code must pass all linting and formatting checks. 
 6.  **Documentation:** All code must be well-documented (docstrings, comments). 
 
 ## Coding Standards 
 
 *   Follow PEP8 for Python code. 
 *   Use TSDoc for TypeScript code. 
 *   Enforce consistent naming conventions. 
 *   Keep files under 500 lines. 
 *   Use the `# Reason:` comment practice. 
 
 ## Onboarding Guide 
 
 *   Project Structure: Overview of the main directories and files. 
 *   Key Modules: Description of the core modules and their responsibilities. 
 *   Common Tasks: Instructions for common development tasks. 
 *   Coding Standards: Link to the coding standards documentation. 
 
 ## .env.example Files 
 
 *   Centralized .env.example files for both frontend and backend. 
 *   Document the purpose, usage, and potential values for each variable. 
 
 ## Diagrams 
 
 *   Add diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid.js) to the docs folder for complex parts of the architecture.
