# ACI Agent Playground User Guide

This guide explains how to use the ACI Agent Playground feature in the frontend, allowing you to interact with agents and test their capabilities.

## 1. Accessing and Starting a New Session

To access the Agent Playground, navigate to the "Playground" section in the frontend application.

Upon entering the Playground, a new session is typically started automatically. If you need to start a new, clean session, look for an option like "New Session" or a similar button, usually located near the message input area or in a sidebar. Clicking this will clear the current conversation history and start a fresh interaction.

## 2. Sending Messages to the Agent

Once a session is active, you can send messages to the agent using the message input area. This is usually a text box at the bottom of the screen.

1.  Type your message into the input box.
2.  Press the "Send" button or hit the Enter key to submit your message to the agent.

The agent will process your message and respond within the same session interface.

## 3. Viewing the Message History

The message history for the current session is displayed in the main area of the Playground interface, above the message input box.

Messages you send and responses from the agent will appear chronologically, allowing you to follow the conversation flow. Scroll up to view earlier messages in the session history.

## 4. Purpose and Basic Functionality

The ACI Agent Playground is designed to provide a direct interface for users to interact with and test deployed agents. Its basic functionality includes:

-   **Direct Interaction:** Send prompts and queries directly to a selected agent.
-   **Real-time Responses:** Receive and view the agent's responses as they are generated.
-   **Session Management:** Start new sessions to have independent conversations with agents.
-   **History Review:** Easily review the full transcript of your interaction within a session.

This feature is useful for understanding an agent's behavior, testing specific prompts, and verifying its functionality before integrating it into other applications or workflows.
