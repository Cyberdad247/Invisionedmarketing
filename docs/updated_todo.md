# Repository Integration Implementation

## Repositories to Integrate
- [x] Invisionedmarketing.git (Main target for integration)
- [x] I-Creations.git (Full features to be integrated)
- [x] ClaraVerse.git (UI/UX to be added to I-creation)
- [x] camel.git (Framework for agent creation)
- [x] camel-ai/owl.git (Workflow and framework to be added to I-creation)
- [x] ten_framework.bak.git (For realtime and edge functions)
- [x] litellm.git (To be integrated)
- [x] Archon.git (For super agent creation bot implementation)

## Audit Process
- [x] Clone each repository
- [x] Analyze repository structure
- [x] Document key features and components
- [x] Identify dependencies
- [x] Assess integration challenges
- [x] Create detailed audit report for each

## Integration Planning
- [x] Identify integration approach for each repository
- [x] Create dependency map
- [x] Develop integration sequence
- [x] Document required modifications
- [x] Create comprehensive integration plan
- [x] Create focused integration plan based on user priorities
